# Quay-Crane-Scheduling-Optimization
Quay Crane Scheduling Optimization in Container Terminals and Sea-Ports, Efficient quay crane scheduling is critical for the productivity and competitiveness of container 
terminals worldwide. This project aims to design an optimization strategy for quay crane 
scheduling in container terminals, with a specific emphasis on the challenges faced by the port 
of Alexandria, Egypt. This study targets enhancing the utilization of resources, minimizing
waiting times, and improving overall terminal performance.
In order to find existing research, methods, and approaches in the area of quay crane 
scheduling, we conducted a literature review, which helped us develop innovative solutions.
We then developed and implemented optimization algorithms and scheduling techniques 
tailored to the specific requirements and challenges faced by container terminals in Alexandria. 
We performed sensitivity analysis on our algorithms and methodologies to assess their 
performance and practical application, and we tested them on real-world data such as container 
volumes and crane operations. Our results show that the suggested scheduling strategy 
improves terminal efficiency overall, decreases vessel completion time, and improves crane 
utilization
